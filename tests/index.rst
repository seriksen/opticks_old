Opticks Integration Tests
=============================

The below high level bash function tests all use the **op.sh** script :doc:`../bin/op` 
to simulate optical photons and save event files.  The functions then use 
python analysis scripts :doc:`../ana/index`   to compare events with each other 
and analytic expectations.

Original README
----------------

A sample Dual Contouring implementation. For more info see http://ngildea.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/implementing-dual-contouring.html

The octree code is based on the original reference code by Tao Ju. The QEF implementation was written by /u/unzret (on reddit.com).
All other code is written by Nicholas Gildea and free for any purpose, assuming that does not conflict with another license.

The sample depends on SDL2, GLM and GLEW. I don't think the particular version matters (beyond the paths in the .vcxproj file). 

Only build materials for VS2013 are provided but it should be easy to move to another environment.

The controls are:
	- hold left mouse and drag to rotate the view
	- use the mouse wheel to zoom in/out
	- press F1 to render a wireframe
	- press F2 to regenerate the octree using a new error threshold (and generate a new mesh)

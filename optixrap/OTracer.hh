/**
OTracer
=========

Instance m_otracer is resident of opticksgl/OKGLTracer.hh 
which coordinates with oglrap/OpticksViz using SRenderer
protocol base.


output_buffer
--------------

OTracer relies on, externally setup 

* output_buffer
* geometry top_object 


* output_buffer typically setup and managed by opticksgl/OFrame.hh
  (done like this as for OpenGL interop the OpenGL buffer needs to be 
  created first, then the OptiX reference to that GPU buffer is made)

* a few tests also "manually" setup an output_buffer 
  eg optixrap/tests/intersect_analytic_test.cc
  but that is not the same format a the pinhole output buffer

oxrap/cu/pinhole_camera.cu
----------------------------

::

   18 rtBuffer<uchar4, 2>   output_buffer;

trace_
--------

* passes composition data (viewpoint, camera param) 
  into OptiX context 

* launches OptiX pinhole camera raytrace writing into 
  pure OptiX output_buffer

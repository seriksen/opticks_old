OptiX 7 : Brand New Lower Level API
======================================= 

* no multi-GPU, no mem mamagement : all that burden is shifted to application
  (Vulkanization of OptiX 6) 
* but its thread safe 

* Introduced Aug 2019 : OptiX 7 API is not backwards compatible


* https://news.developer.nvidia.com/optix-7-delivers-new-levels-of-flexibility-to-application-developers/
* https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1058310/optix/optix-7-0-release/

* https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1058577/optix/porting-to-optix-7/

  Detlef : The OptiX 7 API is completely different and the host code effectively requires a rewrite

     Sounds like OptiX7 not "fork", its the future

     * explicit memory management (standard CUDA)
     * explicit build AS (accel structures)
     * explicit multi-GPU (up to application)
     * no state on host corresponding to scene

       * zero bytes on host
       * improves startup
       * reduce host resources

19:49
     RAY Tracing APIs : 
 
     * Microsoft DXR (DirectX 12) https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/announcing-microsoft-directx-raytracing/
     * NVIDIA VKRay (Vulkan) https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/raytracing/vkray
     * fat OptiX 1-6
     * thin OptiX 7 


     * sustainable APIs 


20:34
     Buffers -> CUDA Pointers 

     Variables -> shader binding table

     Global scoped variables -> Launch parameters

         * enables overlapping of launches asynchronously 

     Semantic variables -> query functions to access internal state (current ray etc..)

     Amorphous programs -> Tagged program types 

     Geometry Group -> Geometry AS (primitives: triangles or programmable) 

     Group -> Instance AS

         * culling and masking availble on Instance basis

     Transform -> Just Input to Instance AS build


24:21
     OptiX 6 : still continuing to support

12:25 BVH flatten scene

   Example : modelling two cars with wheels, 

   * should you instance the wheels and the cars or just copy the wheels into car instances 
   * its faster to keep it flatter, ie copy the wheels into two car instances 

   * Hardware Instancing : your first level is free!

     * ie it can handle one level of descent into a smaller BVH 

   * flatten if you can, ie if you have the memory  
   * better to avoid overlapped BVHs

   BVH : one level of instancing comes for free (ie RT cores handle it)


16:24 Reduce memory access

    Quadro RTX 6000 memory bandwidth : 672 GB/s
    *IF* 10 GRays/s is goal, then :

    672 GB/s /  10 GRays/s = 67.2 bytes/ray  (includes traversal)

    => Care must be taken to stay in this budget
    => way to calculate the upper bound of the ray tracer
  
    ::

       BUT : for me, I dont need to pull all the photons back to 
       the GPU, only interested in those that hit PMTs : so I think
       this memory bandwidth should not be a problem

18:01 8 32-bit registers for payload and attribs

    Performance with RT cores

                               1
    Amdahl's Law :   S =  -------------    
                           (1-p) + p/s

    For RT core speedup to be large, need to be traversal bound
    50:50 shade/traverse  (shade on SM, traverse on RT cores) 
    -> maximum factor 2 speedup

36:39
    rtContextSetUsageReportCallback

39:34
    BVH compaction : can save 1.5x-2x on memory for +10% build time
    on by default, can be switched off

Some examples require to pick the display device only::

   Caught exception: GL interop is only available on display device, please use
   display device for optimal performance.  Alternatively you can disable GL
   interop with --no-gl-interop and run with degraded performance.

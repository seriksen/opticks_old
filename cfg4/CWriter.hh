CWriter
=========

Canonical m_writer instance is resident of CRecorder and is instanciated with it.

Writes step records, final photons and sequence(aka history) entries 
collected from Geant4 into buffers in the "g4evt" OpticksEvent.

In static mode the number of photons is known in advance, in dynamic
mode the buffers are grown as new photons are added.

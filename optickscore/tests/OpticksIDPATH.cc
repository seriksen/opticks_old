Simple executable that dumps the directory of the 
Opticks geocache to stderr. The directory returned 
depends on the arguments provided that select a detector
DAE file and also select subsets of the geometry. 

After setting PATH use::

   args="" # potentially select 

   IDPATH="$(op --idpath 2>&1 > /dev/null)"  # capture only stderr

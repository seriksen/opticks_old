UseOKOP
=========

Compute only PPM snapshots of geometry
(PPM is a primitive uncompressed raster image format).

Default configuration takes 10 raytrace snapshots 
from different angles.::


    UseOKOP
       ## take the snapshots

    open /tmp/snap00000.ppm   

       ## (macOS visualize with Preview.app)                       
       ## will probably need to convert .ppm to .png on Linux

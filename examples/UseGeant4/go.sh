Finding Geant4
=================

Note that Geant4 is found via:: 

  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$(opticks-prefix)/externals 

There is no need (so long as only one G4 version in externals) to use::

  -DGeant4_DIR=$(g4-cmake-dir)

cmake $sdir -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
            -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$(opticks-prefix)/externals \

            -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=$(opticks-home)/cmake/Modules

TODO: move to BOpticksResource, not envvars 

Improving this is stymied, as need access to BOpticksResource 
to avoid envvar crutch, but have prejudice against use of boost 
in cudarap- (is that prejudice still justified, now that I know 
better how to split things between host compiler and nvcc ?).

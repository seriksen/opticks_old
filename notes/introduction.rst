Monte Carlo method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The versatility of the monte carlo method to model complex systems 
has made its use ubiquitous across all sciences.

Accessing Turing's ray tracing features requires using the DirectX Raytracing
(DXR) API, NVIDIA's OptiX engine, or the unreleased Vulkan ray tracing
extensions.

Real-Time Ray Tracing Accelerated by RT Cores

The Turing architecture is armed with dedicated ray-tracing processors called
RT Cores, which accelerate the computation of how light and sound travel in 3D
environments at up to 10 GigaRays a second. Turing accelerates real-time ray
tracing by up to 25x that of the previous Pascal generation, and GPU nodes can
be used for final-frame rendering for film effects at more than 30x the speed
of CPU nodes.

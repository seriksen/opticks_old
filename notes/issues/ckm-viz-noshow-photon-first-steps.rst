=======================================

::

    [blyth@localhost CerenkovMinimal]$ t ckm-viz
    ckm-viz is a function
    ckm-viz () 
    { 
        OPTICKS_KEY=$(ckm-key) $(ckm-dbg) OKTest --natural --envkey --xanalytic
    }



I recall something similar before where photons starting at time zero
are not rendered visibly : perhaps this is the same. Before, 
I simply shifted time from zero. 

Perhaps a more definitive fix this time ?

alignment_notes_index
=========================


Objective
--------------

Theres a wealth of experience in the notes, and reading some of them is the best way to 
jump back into context. But it's difficult to find the useful notes as there are so many of them.

reviewed notes
-----------------

* :doc:`random_alignment`

  * deep into aligned comparison, in the guts of G4 

* :doc:`random_alignment_iterating`

  * instructions on masked running, ie reproducible running of chosen single photons  
  * g4lldb.py dumping
  * tboolean-box-ip outputs in aligned running  
  * Iteration Approach 1 : Directly select/dump non-history aligned records : maligned dumpline approach 
  * "TO AB" "TO BT AB" looks to be trying to do the same thing : velocity bug again perhaps ? NOPE log(double(u))

* :doc:`where_mask_running`

  * how to fast forward to debug single photon 
  * discusses how this was implemented 

* :doc:`sc_ab_re_alignment`

  * discussion of why "--reflectcheat" was simple to implement 
    and why "--scattercheat" "--absorbcheat" are not feasible

* :doc:`RNG_seq_off_by_one`

  * fixing the issue of the dirty dozen, this was just before reached :doc:`tboolean_box_perfect_alignment` 
  * explanation of the devious triple whammy kludge --dbgskipclearzero --dbgnojumpzero --dbgkludgeflatzero 
  * demonstrates the power of masked single photon running for debugging random aligned consumption 
    (this however depends on ana/g4lldb.py so it aing going to work with gdb without an update > gdb 7.0
    and lots of work) 

* :doc:`alignment_kludge_simplification`

  * good overview of the big picture of aligning the bi-simulation

* :doc:`alignment_options_review`

  * recent look at the options --dbgskipclearzero --dbgnojumpzero --dbgkludgeflatzero

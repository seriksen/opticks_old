TODO : Automated Interop Tests
================================

Testing of interop running currently requires
user interaction to dismiss OpenGL windows 
that pop up.

Workout a way to automatically do this, or 
even better avoid popping up a window and 
instead use some non-visible framebuffer.

This would then allow to implement tests that 
compare digests of interop and compute simulations.

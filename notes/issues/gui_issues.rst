bookmark 0, acts loads a far setting but does not save it ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* causes geom to disappear when go back to 0, and trying to update the bookmark
  with space seems not to do so 

* bookmark 0 was special cased to not be updatable with space


somehow getting bookmarks off in outer space ?
--------------------------------------------------

* need a way to delete bookmarks ?


one dir for all direct bookmarks
-------------------------------------

Should have the geo digest in the bookmark directory name, to work with multiple geometries::

    /home/blyth/.opticks/g4live/State


up/down keys increased sensitivity for big geom makes rotation uncontollable
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

try simply ignoring dragfactor for rotation


bookmark 0 gets overwritten at startup
------------------------------------------

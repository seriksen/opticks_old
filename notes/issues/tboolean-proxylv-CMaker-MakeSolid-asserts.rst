X4Solid::convertPolycone from G4VSolid to nnode

* G4Polycone becomes a union of ncylinder
* G4Tubs becomes an ncylinder

CMaker::ConvertPrimitive : back translation from nnode to G4VSolid
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* nnode has no POLYCONE its using ncylinder 

* the back translation sees ncylinder and yields only G4Tubs

* HENCE : THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE nnode MODEL DOESNT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN 
  ncylinder from G4Polycone and ncylinder from G4Tubs, with G4Tubs being
  symetrically restricted and G4Polycone not

* SOLUTION : dont assert, branch to create a G4Polycone when the ncylinder is
  not symmetric and hence G4Tubs cannot be used

ISSUE 1 : CMaker::ConvertPrimitive asserts for PROXYLV 22,26,27,37,38 : expecting symmetrically disposed cylinder 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* hmm seems my fix of baking in the z-shift changes to NCSG and GMesh cannot be translated to Geant4 ?
* solution is to use placement : but the details are kinda painful as have three geometry models to juggle

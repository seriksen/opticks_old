Suspect this will take a long time to fix : it is the double heavy GPU quartic solving.
Another guise of the long standing torus issue striking again.

So perhaps, as only have TITAN RTX for a few more days, and want to 
make some full geometry RTX benchmarks better to :doc:`torus_replacement_on_the_fly`

Big Geometry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Eureka ; avoiding having two InstLODCull active regains sanity, with this proviso frustum culling and LOD forking are both working
* InstLODCull simplifications from moving uniform handling to UBO in RContext


2017 Aug : primitives for JUNO : ellipsoid, torus, hyperboloid : solve-quartic troubles
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Focus on tricky primitives

Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~

* implemented the primitives needed for JUNO ; torus was difficult, also 
  implemented hyperboloid  ; perhaps we can look into replacing torus with 
  hyperboloid for the PMT (it is much much easier computationally, just quadratics rather than quartics)

* moved analytic geometry processing pre-cache ; so launch time is 
  reduced from ~50 s to < 5 s

* improved OpenGL visualisation performance using 
  instance frustum culling and variable level-of-detail meshes for instances (=PMTs) based on 
  distance to the instance.  These techniques use GPU compute (OpenGL transform feedback) 
  prior to rendering each frame to skip instances that are not visible and replace distant instances with simpler
  geometry.   The improved performance will make it much easier to capture moviesâ€¦

  As Macs only go to OpenGL 4.1 ; I am limited to techniques available to that version 
  which means no OpenGL compute shaders.  I could of use CUDA interop techniques but 
  if possible it is better to stick with OpenGL for visualisation as that  can work on AMD 
  (and perhaps even Intel) GPUs, meaning much more users can benefit from it.


Solids
~~~~~~~~~

* using doubles for quartic/cubic Solve now seems inevitable, issues are much reduced with doubles but not entirely fixed
* op --j1707 --gltf 3 ; fully analytic raytrace works, not having any triangles saves gobs of GPU memory ; investigate ways to skip torus intersects
* start on hyperbolic hyperboloid of one sheet, hope to model PMT neck with hyperboloid rather than subtracted torus
* torus artifacts gone, after move SolveCubicStrobachPolyFit to use initial gamma using SolveCubicPolyDivision instead of the cursed SolveCubicNumeric

Big Geometry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* investigate OpenGL LOD and Culling for coping with big geometry
* start checking whats needed to enable instance culling, over in  env- instcull-
* moving analytic GScene into geocache fixes j1707 slow startup, reducing from 50 secs to under 5 secs
* threading LODified meshes thru GGeoLib/GGeoTest
* prep for bringing dynamic GPU LOD fork+frustum culling like env- instcull- into oglrap-, plan to use first class citizen RBuf (of Renderer) to simplify the buffer juggling

* start on primitives needed for juno1707
* add zcut ellipsoid by using zsphere with scaling adjusted to be 1 for z
* investigate torus artifacts, by looking into cubic approach

Validation ; machinery for comparison G4DAE vs GDML/glTF geometries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* generalize GMeshLib to work in analytic and non-analytic branches, regularize GNodeLib to follow same persistency/reldir pattern
* factor GMeshLib out of GGeo and add pre-placed base solid mesh persisting into/from geocache, see GMeshLibTest and --gmeshlib option
* get nnode_test_cpp.py codegen to work with nconvexpolyhedron primitives defined by planes and bbox

* impingement debug by comparison of GDML/glTF and G4DAE branches
* comparing GMesh bbox between branches, reveals lots of discrepancies ; GScene_compareMeshes.rst
* bbox comparisons are productive ; cone-z misinterp, missing tube deltaphi
* csg composite/prim bbox avoids polyfail noise reduces discrepant meshes to 12 percent
* moving to parsurf bbox, avoids overlarge analytic bbox with complicated CSG trees
* adopting adaptive parsurf_level to reach a parsurf_target number of surface points knocks 5 lvidx down the chart

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Polygonization ; move on HY poly taking too long
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* try subdivide border tris approach to boolean mesh combination, tboolean-hyctrl
* decide to proceed regardless despite subdiv problems, forming a zippering approach

Solids ; analytic bbox combination, tree balancing positivize, ndisc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* nbbox::CombineCSG avoids the crazy large bbox
* CSG.subdepth to attempt tree balancing by rotation, swapping left right of UNION and INTERSECTIN nodes when that would improve balance
* honouring the complement in bbox and sdf, testing with tboolean-positivize 
* checking deep csg trees with tboolean-sc
* nbox::nudge finding coincident surfaces in CSG difference and nudging them to avoid the speckled ghost surface issues
* tboolean-uncoincide for debugging uncoincide failure 
* tboolean-esr ; investigate ESR speckles and pole artifacting, from degenerate cylinder
* add disc primitive tboolean-disc as degenerate cylinder replacement
* make CSG_DISC work as a CSG subobject in boolean expressions by adding otherside intersects and rigidly oriented normals
* mono bileaf CSG tree balancing to handle mixed deep trees, used for unions of cylinders with inners done via subtraction

Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* completed transfer of node identity, boundary and sensor info, from triangulated G4DAE to analytic GDML/glTF branches in GScene
* moving to absolute tree handling in gltf with selection mask gets steering of the branches much closer

Validation ; intersect point SDF, SDF scanning, containment(child surf vs parent SDF)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* factor GNodeLib out of GGeo to avoid duplication between GScene and GGeo, aiming to allow comparison of triangulated and analytic node trees
* node names and order from full geometry traversals in analytic and triangulated branches are matching, see ana/nodelib.py
* analytic geometry shakedown begins
* prep automated intersect debug by passing OpticksEvent down from OpticksHub into GScene::debugNodeIntersects

* autoscan all CSG trees looking for internal SDF zeros
* tablulate zero crossing results for all trees, odd crossings almost all unions, no-crossing mostly subtraction
* NScanTest not outside issue fixed via minimum absolute cage delta, all the approx 10 odd crossings CSG trees are cy/cy or cy/co unions in need of uncoincidence nudges

* expand parametric surface coverage to most primitives, for object-object coincidence testing of bbox hinted coincidences
* nnode::getCompositePoints collecting points on composite CSG solid surface using nnode::selectBySDF on the parametric points of the primitives


* NScene::check_surf_points classifying node surface points against parent node SDF reveals many small coincidence/impingement issues 
* avoiding precision issues in node/parent collision (coincidence/impingement) by using parent frame does not make issue go away

/**
OpPropagator : compute only propagator, no viz
==================================================

OpPropagator only used from OpMgr as m_propagator, which is used in
the G4Opticks approach, ie Opticks embedded inside an unsuspecting 
G4 example.   

Residents which are instanciated in ctor:

m_engine:OpEngine :
   control of GPU optical photon propagation

m_tracer:OpTracer 
   can make sequences of raytrace snapshots of geometry
   which can be saved to PPM files for subsequent conversion
   into PNG images or MP4 movies 


DevNotes
----------

Contrast with the viz enabled ok/OKPropagator

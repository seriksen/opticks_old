/**
OpticksGeometry : GGeo holder/loader/fixer 
============================================

Actually OpticksGGeo would be a better name, this acts as a higher 
level holder of GGeo with a triangulated (G4DAE) focus.  
Anything related to analytic (GLTF) should not live here, OpticksHub 
would be more appropriate.

* ACTUALLY ARE NOW THINKING THAT ANALYTIC SHOULD LIVE INSIDE
  A SINGLE GGeo ALONGSIDE THE TRIANGULATED 

Canonical m_geometry instance resides in okg/OpticksHub 
and is instanciated by OpticksHub::init which 
happens within the ok/OKMgr or okg4/OKG4Mgr ctors.

Dev History
-------------

* started as spillout from monolithic GGeo

/**
X4GDMLWrite
=============

Subclass of the standard Geant4 G4GDMLWriteStructure
that adds methods for writing single solids to GDML snippets
either in files or strings.

g4-;g4-cls G4GDMLWrite
g4-;g4-cls G4GDMLWriteStructure

Note that the G4 GDML implementation uses
a bizarre long inheritance chain : so you just have to 
resort to searching for methods.
